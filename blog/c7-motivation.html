          <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
          <p>
            Seeking happiness in this context through 'pleasure' means going after highs. It's instinctive to do this but it's super unsustainable and often has a big low swing afterwards.</br>Passion is when you're getting your happiness from being in 'flow' or being and feeling productive and engaged. This one is harder to get into but ultimately, the pay off tends to be better and there isn't such a low afterwards.</br>The 'higher purpose' kind of happiness derives from being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you or allows you to feel meaningful. This is considered the most sustainable.</br>According to the author, we should spend the most time on the 'higher purpose' stuff, then on 'passion' and sometimes the 'pleasure' side.

          <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
          <p>
            I think this section is one of the most helpful ones for me. I have really struggled with resilience the last few months but feel like it has been geting better as I work through things and take more time for self-care.</br>I struggled to get into the meditation exercise, mainly because of the format. It has kinda been like that for me throughout this book but I use the app Pacifica which has a bunch of guided meditations that use the same ideas.

          <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
          <p>
            This is kinda tricky to answer because I feel like there are lots of ways to answer and lots of values no matter how I answer but here are some of my core values in no particular order:
            <ul>
              <li>Love</li>
              <li>Humour</li>
              <li>Passion</li>
              <li>Kindness</li>
              <li>Fairness</li>
              <li>Authenticity</li>
              <li>Environmentalism</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
          <p>
            Really, it's kind of covered by my core values but things like equality are super important to me, not just for humans but other animals too. Equality really covers a bunch of things to me, like love and fairness. Being gay and multiracial has made it more of a personal battle than it might have been otherwise and maybe that's why I feel particularly passionately about it.
          </p>

          <h5>Other musings</h5>
          <p>
            The section about learning optimism and unlearning pessimism is probably the one that has grabbed me the most so far. I found it particularly interesting when it's mentioned that it takes three good things to make up for one bad one. I've always been aware that I give much more weight to the negative things in my life than the positives and had wondered why I couldn't just be happy with the great things! It's nice to know that it's not uncommon and that it makes sense.
