          This concept made me feel a lot better about how junky my website is looking at the moment. It made me decide to focus a lot more on actually getting the structure there and the most important work done before worrying about every tiny thing I could do to make my pages prettier.

          Like chapter 1, I read this a while back but it my view about meditation didn't really change before or after it because I've already read about all that stuff before.</p>

          One new thing I learned about meditation in this chapter is that it may thicken your neocortex! Like, I knew it strengthened your brain but I didn't know that it could actually result in physical brain gains!

          Although none of the meditation techniques particularly stood out to me because I've experienced them all before, there was a section titled "Happiness Is the Default State of Mind" that really stuck out for me. I've always kind of felt like it has been the opposite but it's a nice change to look at it as trying to get back to the default rather than forcing something unnatural.
