      <p>HTML is the language the computer uses to display things that you see on a web page. CSS is the language that tells the browser how to display things and makes it possible to have all sorts of pretty stuff going on. The DOM kinda brings them together and makes it so you can manipulate things.</p>
      <p>'Boxifying design' is splitting up a web page into boxes that display different things.</p>
      <p>The 'box model' is a box that wraps every HTML element and it's made up of the content in the middle, surrounded by padding, the border and the margin.</p>
