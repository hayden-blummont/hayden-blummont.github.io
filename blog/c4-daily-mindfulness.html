          <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
          <p>
            I chose to do the 'informal practice of mindful listening' and it was interesting how much more I noticed small changes in
            facial expression while still being able to focus on what he was actually saying. I didn't tell him what I was
            doing but I'm sure he appreciated me being quiet for once. Other than that, I haven't really mindfully practiced
            the other two parts of mindfulness conversation.

        <div class="six columns">
          <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
          <p>
            I already try to do at least the one mindful breath a day and try not to go too hard so it becomes a chore so that's the second and third techniques covered. I also chat every day with my friend who is remarkably similar to me and she uses the same app to keep track of her mindfulness meditation. We chat more casually about it than the first technique recommends but it works well for us.
