          <h5>What is a responsive site and why is it important?</h5>
          <p>
            A responsive site is one that adjusts based on the resolution of a screen to render the web page well on an array of different
            screens with varying sizes. This means that the majority of users will have more consistency across devices and
            there doesn't necessarily have to be a totally different mobile site.
          </p>
          <h5>What is a mobile first design and why is it important?</h5>
          <p>
            Mobile first design is when you design what the mobile web page will look like first and then build up to bigger screens,
            adjusting and adding features as the resolution increases. This method means that you don't need a separate mobile
            site which saves time (and money). It's also a good way to get you to prioritise what's really important and
            how you'll show that first.
          </p>
          <h5>What is a framework and what are some of their pros and cons?</h5>
          <p>
            Frameworks in this context are kind of like templates for web pages. Some of them are simple and have just very basic code
            while others are more complete.

              <h5>What is a wireframing and why do we use it?</h5>
              <p>
                A wireframe is a really simplified visual representation of the website that shows the basic elements and where they will
                be on the web page. This allows for clear planning and easy prioritisation.

              <h5>What aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h5>
              <p>
                The main thing I struggled with was getting images not to overlap and as it is I need to come back to this to figure out how to get the images where I want them to be >.<
