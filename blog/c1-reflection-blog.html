      <p>EDA seems to just be a different, smarter way of learning what I need to to get a job in the industry as opposed to going down the uni path. It seems a lot less impersonal than uni too which is super lovely and makes the whole process feel warmer and less stressful </p>
      <p>I get the impression that there's a lot of genuine care involved in the whole process from other students and everyone running the show. It also seems like the smartest first step for me in this journey because it's a hell of a lot of info in a short amount of time which makes a lot more sense for me with how I learn</p>
      <p>I definitely tend to have some more introverted characteristics but I feel much more comfortable engaging with people involved with EDA simply because everyone is so darn lovely.</p>
      <p>It's a lot more personal and collaborative than I thought it would be for sure but it's a great thing to be! I guess I expect it to be more like that rather than just trying to bash all this stuff into my brain alone now.</p>
      <p>I'm excited and nervous but in the way I swing wildly between the two. That said, the more I do, the more excitement there is and less anxiety.</p>
