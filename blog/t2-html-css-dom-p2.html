      <p>A grid based design is a design method where you split the page into a grid and then contain certain elements within certain boxes. It allows for more balanced looking pages and tends to make them more aesthetically pleasing because of this.</p>
      <p>Having a responsive web page means that it will adjust according to the resolution of the screen on different devices. This means that there's a more consistent look to things and you can make your pages more user-friendly</p>
      <p>Semantic structure is a way of telling browsers what to display using tags. They describe the content rather than just the appearance eg. <em> for bold text.</p>
