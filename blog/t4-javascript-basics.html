          <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
          <p>
            HTML is used to create basic structure and contain some of the content of a web page and CSS is used for design, including
            where things are positioned and how they look. JavaScript helps to make the webpage more interactive. It seems
            to allow for a lot more customisation of elements than HTML or CSS and is considered harder to learn.
          </p>
          <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing
            your teeth'.</h5>
          <p>
            The control flow is the "order in which the computer executes statements in a script." Loops allow you to run through the
            same code multiple times with different values until a certain condition or conditions are met. A real life example
            of this would be the process of brewing tea for three of your friends. You would need to go through a bunch of
            steps like those below: 1 - Get mug 2 - Get teabag 3 - Put teabag in mug 4 - Pour in hot water 5 - Let brew 6
            - Take out teabag If you're doing them all at once, there would be a loop three times on step 1 to get all three
            mugs, then step 2 to get the teabags and again in steps 3 and 4. Step 5 wouldn't need looping as the tea can
            brew at the same time but taking out the teabags would need to be repeated three times, so there's a loop there
            too. Alternatively, each step could be done in order once at a time and the loop would be all six steps repeated,
            one mug of tea being made each loop.

          <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
          <p>
            Arrays are indexed numerically and can hold more than one value or element at a time that can be accessed by referring to the index number.

            Objects are indexed using names written in camel case and can be accessed by referring to that name.

          <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h5>
          <p>
            A function is a chunk of code that when it gets executed does a certain task that it was designed for. 
            
            Functions are useful because they can allow for more efficiency and makes a webpage easier to interact with.
