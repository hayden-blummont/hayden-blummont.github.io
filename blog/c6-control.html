          <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
          <p>
            When I get blocked by something, sometimes I get unreasonably frustrated and grumpy about it, especially if I was on a good roll and know that the block has a super easy solution I just can't see. That said, I also get crazily excited and happy when things do go well and I feel productive which some would argue is also a disproportionate emotional response.

          <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
          <p>
            This exercise is one I don't really find terribly helpful. It might sound silly but there are just too many steps and it's impractical in a lot of stressful situations. I find it more useful to just focus on my breath and then think about the thing less formally. The mnemonic is honestly terrible too lol. I do a similar mindfulness meditation using an app called Pacifica and it helps me cool down pretty well, so I'll probably just stick with that.
