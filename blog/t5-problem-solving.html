          <h5>Trouble with JavaScript logic in sprint-5</h5>
          <p>
            I was having a lot of trouble understand how JavaScript functions work and what everything means. The jargon was really confusing
            me and I was struggling to make progress. I ended up reading a whole bunch about it and watching YouTube videos
            to try get a better understanding. These things definitely helped but I felt like I needed to talk it over with
            someone and work through it at the same time.
            </br></br>
            I ended up going and sitting with a great nerd friend who refuses to tell me answers flat out, but rather makes sure I understand
            the logic before we go through step by step. Sometimes I'll have a small epiphany while he's talking and end
            up the problem with my code or realise what I need to do and excitedly smash away at the keys before he can get
            to the grand finale. Rude, I know.
            </br></br>
            I go through a crazy myriad of emotions when I get blocked. Ya boy feels a lotta things (lol), but seriously, sometimes I'll
            just see it as a fun challenge but then I'm suddenly yelling "WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING?!" and I just want to lie
            face-down on the floor for a few months to recuperate. Obviously, I get over these moments pretty quickly (sometimes
            it takes a little longer and some pretty intense meditating, though), and then I feel determined AF!
            </br></br>
            From struggling with this stuff, I learned that I really do just need a break sometimes but the ideal length is nowhere near
            as long as my instincts tell me. If I force myself to try again after a few hours or the next day, I tend to
            get on a roll again pretty quick. Times that I've given myself a couple of days because it was stressing me out
            were totally unproductive and I just spent those days worrying. I need to work to get past the frustrated, wanting-to-give-up
            stage quicker and get back on the horse, so to speak.

          <h5>Reflecting on how confident I am using problem solving techniques</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I'm haven't really formally done this yet but I think I have a fair understanding of it. It's kinda just the
            stuff I say out loud to myself. 
            </br></br>
            <strong>Trying something</strong> - I'm super confident doing this. I type a lot of nonsensical junk but now and then it works!
            </br></br>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I haven't done this but I do talk to myself a lot...
            </br></br>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I've been getting better with this and finding Developer Tools super handy!
            </br></br>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong> - I have no idea how to use this. Definitely something I should look back on...
            </br></br>
            <strong>Googling</strong> - My googling skills are pretty legit but sometimes they just don't cut it. I need to look at better ways to find stuff again. I always forget all the little tips and tricks!
            </br></br>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - I'm pretty confident doing this, especially considering how many people have offered to help!
            </br></br>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I haven't really done this yet but would be happy to if I needed to. My friend has managed to absorb that so far.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I haven't set formal reflection time but when I wake up in the morning I often do this and I end up feeling more motivated and sometimes having good ideas.
