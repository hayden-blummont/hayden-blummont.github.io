          <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
          <p>
            Self-awareness allows you to more easily notice when things are going on that have an effect on your emotions, view of yourself
            or self-confidence. Cultivating the skill of being self-aware allows you to be more mindful of these things so
            that you can make more conscious, thought-out decisions rather than going for a crazy, knee-jerk reaction. It
            can also help to build confidence and a sense of self-worth.
          </p>

          <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
          <p>
            I really like this little section as it really gets the point across that your feelings don't define you, they're just something that you're experiencing. Like other challenges, they can be worked at whereas if I hold onto thoughts like, 'I'm anxious' or 'I'm an anxious person,' it makes it seem like something I can't really change or improve. It's too final.

          <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience
            of it? How did you feel?</h5>
          <p>
            I tried the body scan and the experience was just like others I've had doing similar meditations. As I scan through my body, I often feel strange waves and feel like I'm spinning and/or dropping which I really enjoy. I like how heavy I feel and how I feel like I'm barely conscious but fully aware of just a few things that I'm feeling. It's a good break from feeling quite anxious a lot of the time and I feel refreshed and calm afterward.
