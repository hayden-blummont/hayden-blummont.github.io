    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>I've tried the Pomodoro Technique (but fell off the wagon before I gave it a really good shot). I've also tried just going hard for 4 hours taking a couple of short breaks and have been relatively productive doing that but I'd love to be able to work longer than 4 hours before my brain starts to throw in the towel on thinking in general. I have been turning off WiFi on my phone and closing Facebook on my laptop so I don't get as distracted by things like people messaging but that in itself sometimes makes me so anxious that I can't focus. This is all really helping me see where to improve though which is awesome.</p>
    <p>I find it interesting just how often I get distracted despite knowing what my distractions are. I think practicing mindfulness more could help with that but I'll need to practice more and more consistently. </p>
    <p>I think that the mindfulness stuff is really working for me and although I started practicing before EDA, but this is like an extra motivation for me to stick with it, especially when I notice improvements.</p>
    <p>I really want to practice more mindfulness stuff and try the Pomodoro Technique more. My biggest challenge at the moment is getting nowhere near enough sleep (despite my best efforts) but I think if I can improve that, I'll have a lot less trouble getting myself to sit down and get shit done.</p>
