    <h1>Cultural Blog Part 2</h1>
    <p>I read chapter one of Search Inside Yourself a couple of months ago so can't remember it totally but have been working through some of the things from it alongside really similar stuff my therapist has given me. This mainly focuses on mindfulness plus positive affirmations and general mental self-care. It all sounds a bit silly sometimes but if it works it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
    <p>I find mindfulness stuff really quite calming and good at the shorter lengths but find it hard to reign in my wandering mind for periods much longer than five minutes most of the time.</p>
